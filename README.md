# MBDyn Entry Test Repository

This repository is part of the entry test to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2019 under the [MBDyn organization](https://www.mbdyn.org/)

A detailed information about the entry test can be found in [this page](https://eriveltongualter.github.io/GSoC2019-MBDyn/)

Unfortunally, I was not able to fork the following repository: https://public.gitlab.polimi.it/DAER/mbdyn. Then, I just added the modified files in this repo under the folder *Modified Files from Source Code*, which are:

- solver.cc
- solve.h

Also, you can find here the MBDyn codes:

- double_rigid_pendulum.mbd
- triple_rigid_pendulum.mbd

As well the matlab files:

- double_post_processing.m
- triple_post_processing.m.

This is MBDyn's module for the wind-turbine aerodynamics library AeroDyn,
developed by NREL <http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/aerodyn/>.

You need a patched version of AeroDyn built as a (static) library
"libAeroDyn.a" to build this module.

Patch and instructions in contrib/Patches/.
Current patch is "aerodyn-12.58-mbdyn.patch".

Either place the library where the linker can find it (e.g. in /usr/lib)
or in this directory.

To enable model debug output, #define MODULE_AERODYN_DEBUG
when building the module (either set CPPFLAGS="-DMODULE_AERODYN_DEBUG=1"
or manually edit <module-aerodyn.cc>)

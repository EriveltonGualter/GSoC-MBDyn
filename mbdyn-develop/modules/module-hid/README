This module registers a file driver that captures the input
from HID USB devices (only tested with some
joysticks).

The file "hid.set" declares some variables that are used
by all joysticks.

The files "hid_ms_sidewinder.set" and "hid_thrustmaster.set"
sets some of those variables as appropriate for the joystick
they refer to.

The file "hid_test" implements a simple model that reads
(most) inputs and assigns their value to abstract nodes.

The file "hid_airplane" implements a simple rigid-body
"airplane" model that reads the main controls from the joystick
and echoes them, along with aircraft parameters, through a stream
that is supposed to be read by some visualization software.
To test, read it with

sudo socket2stream -P airplane.sock -n 6

(edit as needed).

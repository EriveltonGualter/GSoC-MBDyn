MBDyn and gnuplot

At present, MBDyn's porsprocessing capabilities are quite limited.
Output occurs on plain ascii files, divided by items and sometimes
even not in a fixed format.  In our practice, the most convenient
way to treat these files is by means of appropriate combinations of
UNIX filters and plotting tools; a large role is played by gnuplot.

MBDyn comes with a set of tools that are built against the same 
internal libraries, to ensure uniformity of data treatment.  They 
include:

	any2rot		(not impl.)
	autopilot
	c81
	cl
	eu2rot
	posrel
	rot2any		(not impl.)
	rot2eu
	rot2eup
	rotrel
	sockdrive
	vec2rot

These utilities are described below

	autopilot

calls a running MBDyn process on a socket to interactively alter the
values of socket file drives (you can also use telnet if you know the 
protocol :);

	c81

reads c81 aerodynamic data files and computes coefficients for a given
angle of attack and Mach number;

	cl

a command line calculator that uses the same math processor invoked
when input files are read;

	eu2rot

converts a stream of triples of Euler angles (in 123 sequence) into 
the corresponding rotation matrix;
	
	posrel

converts a stream of data (three coordinates, three Euler angles 
in 123 sequence, and other three coordinates) into a relative position,
i.e. x1a,x2a,x3a,e1,e2,e3,x1b,x2b,x3b => R*(xa-xb);
	
	rot2eu

converts a stream of rotation matrices into the corresponding triple 
of Euler angles;
	
	rot2eup

converts a stream of rotation matrices into the corresponding quadruple
of Euler parameters;
	
	rotrel [{mat|euler}]

converts a stream of two triples of Euler angles (in 123 sequence) into 
the corresponding relative rotation matrix (mat) or relative Euler angles
(default or euler);
	
	sockdrive

calls a running MBDyn process on a socket to alter the values 
of socket file drives in one shot mode (you can also use telnet 
if you know the protocol :);

	vec2rot

converts a stream of two-vector notation data into the corresponding
rotation matrix (e.g. ia,v1a,v2a,v3a,ib,v1b,v2b,v3b => R).

These utilities can be proficiently used to plot non-trivial data
with gnuplot.

Examples

To plot the relative rotation of two nodes about axis 1 of the first one:

	plot "<awk '\
		$1==@@NODE1@@ { \
			a1=$5;a2=$6;a3=$7 \
		} \
		$1==@@NODE2@@ { \
			print a1,a2,a3,$%,$6,$7 \
		}' @@FILENAME@@.mov \
		| rotrel mat \
		| rot2phi \
		| awk '{ \
			print @@DELTAT@@*i++,$1*$2 \
		}'"

\chapter{Getting the package}

\section{MBDyn}
The package can be downloaded in source form from
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.aero.polimi.it/\~{}mbdyn/}}{http://www.aero.polimi.it/\~{}mbdyn/}
\end{center}

Binary releases and snapshots are also available for Windows 2000/XP at
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.aero.polimi.it/\~{}masarati/Download/mbdyn/}}{http://www.aero.polimi.it/~masarati/Download/mbdyn/},
compiled with Cygwin (see
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.cygwin.com/}}{http://www.cygwin.com/})
and thus require \kw{cygltdl-3.dll};
they are provided to Windows users to save them the burden of installing
Cygwin (very easy and straightforward, though) and to compile a package
under an unfamiliar environment.
However, no support is provided for those builds, unless problems
are easily identifiable as related to the sources and not to the OS,
and they impact the UN*X version as well.

MBDyn may use a wide range of packages, if available on the host system
and correctly detected by \kw{configure}.

\section{Mathematical Utilities}
MBDyn may exploit the availability of some mathematical utilities;
neither of them is required for a basic compilation, but they may
be useful or required for specific features.

\subsection{ATLAS}\label{sec:DOWNLOAD:NUMERICAL:ATLAS}
The Automatically Tunable Linear Algebra Subroutines are
a replacement of the standard BLAS.
They are exploited by the linear solver Umfpack
(see Section~\ref{sec:DOWNLOAD:SOLVERS:UMFPACK})
and can be used by Lapack (see Section~\ref{sec:DOWNLOAD:SOLVERS:LAPACK})
and other packages that require BLAS
(see Section~\ref{sec:DOWNLOAD:NUMERICAL:BLAS}).

Note that ATLAS provides its own implementation of Lapack
but only for a limited set of functions.
This set of functions is packed into an archive called \kw{liblapack.a},
so in typical installations it may shadow complete implementations
of the Lapack package.
A useful ``trick'' to have a complete Lapack installation that exploits
ATLAS performances where available is described in
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html\#completelp}}{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html\#completelp}.
The essential instructions are reported below, assuming that
\kw{\$ATLAS} and \kw{\$LAPACK} respectively are the paths to your ATLAS
and Lapack static library archive files:
\begin{verbatim}
  mkdir tmp
  cd tmp
  ar x $ATLAS/liblapack.a
  cp $LAPACK/liblapack.a $ATLAS/liblapack.a
  ar r $ATLAS/liblapack.a *.o
  cd ..
  rm -rf tmp
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{BLAS}\label{sec:DOWNLOAD:NUMERICAL:BLAS}
The Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines
can be used by Umfpack (see Section~\ref{sec:DOWNLOAD:SOLVERS:UMFPACK})
and other packages.
Specially tuned binaries for each architecture (processor type,
cache size and other special hardware features) are advisable;
otherwise, instead of compiling them of your own, ATLAS
(see Section~\ref{sec:DOWNLOAD:NUMERICAL:ATLAS}) are considered
a better replacement.


\section{Linear Solvers}
MBDyn may use a variety of linear solvers

\subsection{Naive}
The Naive solver is also native.
It is especially meant for medium size problems (between 100 and 1000
unknowns) and is essentially a sparse solver optimized for speed
rather than memory usage.

\subsection{Y12}
The Y12 solver is also built-in.
the MBDyn Project distributes the Y12 library
\textbf{AS IS} and \textbf{WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY} as part
of the source code, with no copyright statement and no license.
Of course credits go to the original Authors:
Zahari Zlatev, Jerzy Wasniewski, and Kjeld Schaumburg,
Comp.\ Sci., Math.\ Inst., University of Aarhus,
Ny Munkegade, DK 8000 Aarhus.
This solver is recommended for moderate to large problems,
if Umfpack (see Section~\ref{sec:DOWNLOAD:SOLVERS:UMFPACK})
is not available.

\subsection{Umfpack}\label{sec:DOWNLOAD:SOLVERS:UMFPACK}
The Umfpack linear sparse solver library must be downloaded separately, from
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/}}{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/}.
Credit goes to Timothy A.\ Davis, University of Florida.
Umfpack is used by permission; please read its Copyright,
License and Availability note.
It is used as the standard sparse solver by MATLAB (see
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.mathworks.com/}}{http://www.mathworks.com/}).
This solver is recommended for very large problems,
and as a general purpose solver.

\section{Utilities}

\section{Communication}

\subsection{MPI}

\subsection{Metis}
Metis is a package that performs automatic domain decomposition.
It is used by the Schur solution manager to partition the model
into submodels of nearly equal computational cost and with minimal
interface size.
Its compilation is straightforward.
It can be downloaded from
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/\~{}karypis/metis/metis/}}{http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/metis/}.
Its compilation for MBDyn used to require a special patch to cleanup
its namespace; now the patch is no longer required as a better namespace
separation has been operated.
No installation procedure is provided as of version 4.0; at the end
of compilation, the library \kw{libmetis.a} is available in the build tree,
and it should be copied to a directory where the loader can locate it;
the headers \kw{Lib/*.h} should be copied where the C preprocessor
can locate them.

\section{Real-Time}

\subsection{RTAI}

\section{Build Environments}

\subsection{GNU/Linux}
The preferred build environment is GNU/Linux, using gcc, g++
and either g77 or gfortran.

\subsection{Windows: CygWin}
MBDyn has been successfully compiled under CygWin.
No special requirement is known.
Special attention is required to build with some specific feature,
significantly run-time loadable modules.

\subsection{Windows: MSYS/MinGW}
MBDyn has been successfully compiled under MSYS/MinGW.
Special attention needs to be played to what version is used.

Download packages from
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.mingw.org/}}{http://www.mingw.org/}.

Required packages (in order of installation):
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe} (install wizard)
\item \kw{MSYS-1.0.10.exe} (install wizard; if not automagically done,
edit file \kw{/etc/fstab} as indicated in MSYS' documentation)
\item \kw{msysDTK-1.0.1.exe} (install wizard)
\item \kw{gcc-core-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz}
	(archive; untar after changing directory into \kw{/mingw})
\item \kw{gcc-g++-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz}
	(archive; untar after changing directory into \kw{/mingw})
\item \kw{gcc-g77-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz}
	(archive; untar after changing directory into \kw{/mingw})
\item \kw{msys-libtool-1.5.tar.bz2}
	(archive; untar after changing directory into \kw{/})
\end{itemize}



\subsection{PowerPC: Mac OS X}
(Reported by Torsten Sadowski, blindly reported here)

You have to tell \texttt{configure} where to find \texttt{fink}
includes and libraries
\begin{verbatim}
  export LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib
  export CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include
\end{verbatim}




\chapter{Building}
The configuration of the MBDyn package is based on GNU's autotools
(see \htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.gnu.org/}}{http://www.gnu.org/}
for details).

  --with-hydr             with hydraulic stuff (yes)

  --with-module=<list>    build listed modules (see modules/)
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Multithread Assembly/Solution}
The switch \kw{-{}-enable-multithread} enables multithreaded assembly;
it defaults to \kw{auto}, i.e.\ if the system meets the following
requirements, it is automatically enabled.
Essentially, a working \kw{-lpthread} library and a POSIX compliant
\kw{pthread.h} header must be available.
Currently, only the SuperLU sparse threaded solver is available;
it is experimental.
A threaded implementation of the built-in \kw{naive} sparse solver
is under development.

\subsection{Schur Parallel Solver}
The Schur parallel solver is enabled by using the switch
\kw{-{}-enable-schur}.
It requires a working MPI library with the \kw{ch} driver
and the C++ interface, and a partitioning library.
The MPI library is selected by the switch \kw{-{}-with-mpi},
which allows to specify the value \kw{pmpi} if the profiling
version of the library is to be used.
Note that recent MPI releases by default only build the profiling
version of the C++ library, so the \kw{pmpi} value is mandatory.
Currently, the only partitioning library that is supported by MBDyn
is METIS; a patch to support Chaco is being incorporated,
and may be available in future releases.
The Schur solver is not compatible with the multithreaded
assembly/solution, so if no switch is specified and the system
meets the requirements for both, the multithreaded assembly wins
over the Schur solver.
As a consequence, the schur solver should be explicitly enabled.

\subsection{Real-Time Simulator}
The real-time simulator is enabled by using the switch
\kw{-{}-with-rtai}, which essentially detects the availability
of the mandatory headers of the GNU/Linux Real-Time Application
Interface.
These headers changed between 2.4.13 and 3.X; both versions
are automatically detected.

\chapter{Installing}
Run \kw{make install}; this essentially installs the binary,
the utilities, the man page and the dynamic modules, if any.

\chapter{Executing}
Prepare an input file and run \kw{mbdyn -f <input> -o <output>}.

\section{Regular Execution}

\section{Parallel Execution}

\section{Real-Time Execution}

\section{External Execution}
To run MBDyn as a Simulink module, use the \kw{SimulinkInterface}
that is available under \kw{contrib/}.

\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\chapter{HOWTOs}
This chapter contains mini-howtos about typical significant
configurations of MBDyn as performed by the developers.
Feel free to contribute your own if you had to do any unusual
configuring to meet special needs.

\section{Run-Time Modules}
To enable run-time loading of modules, a powerful means to extend
MBDyn functionality, one needs to:
\begin{itemize}
\item install, and let MBDyn detect, the ltdl library, an ancillary
library of libtool that handles platform-independent run-time loading
of software modules;
\item enable run-time loading of modules; this requires to configure
MBDyn with \kw{{-}{-}enable-runtime-loading};
\item when using gcc, it is recommended to add \kw{-rdynamic} to
the \kw{LDFLAGS} environment variable; this is required to make
functions and objects provided by MBDyn available in the modules;
\item when developing a custom module, it must be placed in a subdirectory
of the directory \kw{modules/}, named \kw{module-name/}.
The module should be contained in one file, with the same name
of the directory plus the language-specific extension; this should be
	\begin{itemize}
	\item C: \kw{module-name.c};
	\item C++: \kw{module-name.cc};
	\item Fortran 77: \kw{module-name.f}.
\end{itemize}
\item the building of each module must be explicitly enabled;
this requires to configure with \kw{{-}{-}with-module=list},
providing a list of the module names (without the leading \kw{module-}).
\end{itemize}
For example, to enable run-time loading and to build the \kw{wheel2} module,
use
\begin{verbatim}
    $ ./configure --enable-runtime-loading --with-module=wheel2
\end{verbatim}
Occasionally, one may want to statically build some well-known modules
into MBDyn, specifically those that implement new elements.
This requires to configure with \kw{{-}{-}with-static-modules}.
After that, the user-defined elements are available as joints.
Currently, only the \kw{wheel2} module can be statically built
into MBDyn; this feature will require some reworking.

Run-time loading of dynamic modules is known to work on any flavor
of GNU/Linux on X86/X86\_64 and on Windows using Cygwin, when compiled
with gcc.
It may work on other architectures and with other compilers, but it has
not been tested by, nor reported to, the Developers.


\section{Schur Solver}
This section describes how the Schur parallel solver available
within the MBDyn package has been successfully compiled and executed
on a dual Athlon SMP machine.
By no means it is intended to suggest how the related packages
should be built for other purposes, nor it may represent a replacement
for the original build and install procedures.
Please refer to the documentation available with each package
for more details or for troubleshooting.

\noindent
Software prerequisites:
\begin{itemize}
\item gcc/g++/g77 >= 3.0 (tested with gcc/g++/g77 3.2.1, 3.3.1 and 3.4.0)
\end{itemize}
Software requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item MBDyn 1.2.1
\item mpich 1.2.5.2
\item Metis 4.0
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{MPI}
\begin{itemize}
\item download \kw{mpich.tar.gz} from
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/}}{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/}
\item untar the package in a temporary directory
\item configure the package with
\begin{verbatim}
    $ ./configure -rsh=ssh --disable-f77 --prefix=/usr/local/mpich
\end{verbatim}
\item \kw{make} the package
\item \kw{make install}
\item edit \kw{/usr/local/mpich/share/machines.<arch>} to enumerate
the max number instances of the MBDyn process you want to allow
on each machine; in my case \kw{<arch>} is LINUX (more details in
\kw{/usr/local/mpich/doc/mpichman-chp4.pdf}).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Metis}
\begin{itemize}
\item download XXX from

\item untar it in a temporary directory
\item make sure the compiler can find headers from MPI and Metis
by defining
\begin{verbatim}
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/mpich/include \
        -I/usr/local/mpich/include/mpi2c++ \
        -I/usr/local/include/metis"
\end{verbatim}
\item make sure the linker can find the libraries from MPI and Metis
by defining
\begin{verbatim}
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/mpich/lib \
        -L/usr/local/lib"
\end{verbatim}
\item configure MBDyn by running
\begin{verbatim}
    $ ./configure --with-mpi=pmpi --with-metis --enable-schur \
        --prefix=/usr/local
\end{verbatim}
\item \kw{make} the package
\item \kw{make install} the package
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Run It!} \mbox{} \\
To test the system, one needs a test input file; the example
\kw{cantilever2} from
\htmladdnormallink{\kw{http://www.aero.polimi.it/\~{}mbdyn/documentation/examples/}}{http://www.aero.polimi.it/\~{}mbdyn/documentation/examples/}
should do the trick.
The input file does not need any specific change, unless special
features are required.
To run it on an SMP machine, simply execute
\begin{verbatim}
    $ /usr/local/mpich/bin/mpirun -np 2 mbdyn -f cantilever2 -o /tmp/ -ss

To test the system, one needs a test input file; the example
\kw{pendulum} in the subdirectory \kw{examples}
should do the trick.
\begin{itemize}
\item start Matlab
\item add the subdirectory \kw{contrib/SimulinkInterface} to Matlab's
path, by executing
\begin{verbatim}
    > path('<path/to>/contrib/SimulinkInterface', path);
\end{verbatim}
\item execute simulink by clicking on the related icon, or by running
\begin{verbatim}
    > simulink
\end{verbatim}
\item open the model by clicking \kw{File->Open} on the menubar
\item run the model by clicking \kw{Simulation->Start} on the menubar.
some times, the first run fails; we're still trying to track that down.
In case, just try again...

\section{Scicos Interface}
\label{sec:ScicosInterface}
This section describes how the Scicos \cite{SCICOS} interface available
within the MBDyn package has been successfully compiled and executed.
By no means it is intended to suggest how the related packages
should be built for other purposes, nor it may represent a replacement
for the original build and install procedures.
Please refer to the documentation available with each package
for more details or for troubleshooting.

An analogous interface with Simulink \cite{SIMULINK}
is described in Section~\ref{sec:SimulinkInterface}.

\chapter{Developers}

\section{Prepare for Building}
Developers need to prepare the build environment by running
\begin{verbatim}
    $ ./bootstrap.sh
\end{verbatim}
This need appropriate versions of the autotools:
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{automake}: there seems to be no special version requirement;
\item \kw{autoconf}: there seems to be no special version requirement;
\item \kw{libtool}: needs to be at least version 1.5.
\end{itemize}

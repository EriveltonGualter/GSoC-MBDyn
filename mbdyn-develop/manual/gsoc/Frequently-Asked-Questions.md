# What is this year's entry test?
Please refer to the [dedicated Wiki page](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/wikis/Google-Summer-of-Code/Entry-Test)

# What are my chances of being selected?
Being selected to do the GSoC with MBDyn depends on many factors out of your control such as the number of applicants and the number of slots we have available. However, based on our experience over the past 3 years we can say that if you complete the entry test properly you have very very high probabilty of being selected.

Why? Because the entry test is designed to be challenging. Most students have a hard time going beyond step 2. Developing for MBDyn requires very specific skills (among them, for most of the projects, C++ programming and an understanding of general concepts of multibody dynamics) that are difficult to find in students at your level. Therefore, if you're made it through the entry test, it means that you have a skill set that is rare among GSoC applicants. We will be certainly interested in selecting you.

# How to get in touch, familiarize with the project, and discuss possible activities?
You can subscribe to the user's mailing list [mbdyn-users@mbdyn.org](), posting a message to introduce yourself. 

# How can I search the mailing list to avoid posting questions that have already been answered?
On most search engines you can add the string site:http://lists.mbdyn.org/pipermail/mbdyn-users/ before your search query to limit your search to the mailing list archive and quickly verify if the questions you have were already answered in the past.

# Where to find information about the project?
Check the [official website](https://www.mbdyn.org/), with specific reference to "Documentation", "Software Download", and search/browse the archives of the mailing list.

# What NOT to ask for?
Questions like "where can I find information on the project" are already answered on the website (e.g. in the FAQ, or in the many documents and presentations available).

# What are prospective applicants supposed to do?
They are supposed to:
  - browse the documentation, to understand what the project is intended for
  - download the software, make sure they are able to compile and execute it
  - familiarize with software usage by running simple problems (e.g. initial value problems described in the tutorials and in the examples page)

\chapter{Data}\label{sec:DATA}
The \kw{data} section is read directly by the driver program. It is
included between the cards:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \kw{begin} : \kw{data} ;
        # ...
    \kw{end} : \kw{data} ;
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}

\section{Problem}
The only active card is the \kw{problem} card.

The syntax is
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{card} ::= \kw{problem} : \bnt{problem_name} ;

    \bnt{problem_name} ::= \{ \kw{initial value} | \kw{inverse dynamics} \} ;
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
For long time the only supported problem type was the
\kw{initial value} problem.
As a consequence, if no \kw{problem} card is present,
an initial value problem is assumed.
An experimental \kw{inverse dynamics} problem is supported as well.

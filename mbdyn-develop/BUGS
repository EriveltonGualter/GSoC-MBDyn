1.1.1
	- There's a library cross-dependency that's not appropriately 
	  handled by recent versions of libtool (e.g. 1.4.1).
	  libbase.a must be linked twice (at least on GNU/Linux with gcc 3.1)
	  but recent libtools detect the duplicate linking and remove
	  the first occurrence.  It has been temporarily fixed by 
	  deceiving libtool with a simple trick, but it is likely
	  this will be removed in the future.  In the meanwhile we'll
	  figure out a clean way to avoid the double linking.
	  Everything works fine with libtool 1.3.4.

1.3.2
	- Schur solver seems to have issues in the interface solver,
	  related to the number of partitions

	- Some versions of g++ 3.2 and 3.3 don't like some perfectly
	  legal C++ constructs used throughout MBDyn.  Occasionally,
	  when detected, they are worked around using less clean,
	  less efficient constructs, typically #ifdef'd with
	  MBDYN_X_WORKAROUND_GCC_3_2 and MBDYN_X_WORKAROUND_GCC_3_3.
	  However, since those compiler versions are seldom available,
	  this issue is no longer consistently checked and worked around.
	  If you spot more occurrences, as the code evolves, please feel
	  free to notify it, possibly with a patch that works around
	  the issue.

1.3.4
	- (-x^y) is equivalent to ((-x)^y) instead of (-(x^y)).

all versions
	- y12/cc interaction (throws ErrRebuildMatrix)
	- multithread assembly broke with g++ >= 4.4

GENERALIZED PREDICTIVE CONTROL:

- USAGE
the executable files is "s2sctrl" and it requires an input file:

	./s2sctrl GPCdata.txt

the "GPCdata.txt" file contains all the input data for the GPC regulator.

- GPC INPUT FILE STRUCTURE

An example of the GPC input file structure is provided with the "GPCdataExample.txt" file.
Each line as the following format:
	ParameterName: ParameterValue
The file format is fixed: all the lines must be present and ordered as in the example. The
parameter name ("ParameterName") cannot be change, just the value ("ParameterValue") can be
modified. No extra characters can be typed after the parameter value (no colon, semi-colon, etc).

- PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION

1. ModelOrder

	The "ModelOrder" must be an integer greater than zero. It is the ORDER of the
	identified ARX model.

2. InputNumber

	The "InputNumber" must be an integer greater than zero. It is the number of INPUTS
	of the identified ARX model, and therefore it is also the number of control
	variables.

3. OutputNumber

	The "OutputNumber" must be an integer greater than zero. It is the number of OUTPUTS
	of the identified ARX model, and therefore it is also the number of measured
	variables.

4. SimplyProperFlag

	The "SimplyProperFlag" must be equal to 1 or 0. With the value 1 a SIMPLY proper
	ARX model is identified, whereas with the value 0 a STRICTLY proper model is
	identified. (WARNING: the SIMPLY proper case has not been deeply tested)

5. ControlFrequency
	
	The "ControlFrequency" must be grater than zero . It is the control frequency in Hz 
	and it is used just to convert the time from second to time steps. The actual control
	frequency must be set in the MBDyn model by means of the "input every" and "output every"
	parameters in the "stream output" and "file stream".

6. ForgettingFactor

	The "ForgettingFactor" must be greater than zero and lesser or equal to one. It is
	the forgetting factor of the Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm used to compute the
	ARX model matrices.

7. CovarianceInitialization

	The "CovarianceInitialization" must be grater than zero. In the RLS algorithm the 
	covariance matrix P is initialized as P = CovarianceInitialization*I, where I is
	an identity matrix. 

8. MeasuresPreconditioningWindowLength

	The "MeasuresPreconditioningWindowLength" must be an integer. It is the number of previous
	time steps used to compute the mean value of the measures. The measures are preconditioned
	before to be used in the RLS algorithm subtracting their mean value. 
	If a negative "MeasuresPreconditioningWindowLength" is defined, the mean value is not
	subtracted.

9. ControlHorizon
	
	The "ControlHorizon" must be an integer grater than zero. It is the length (in time steps)
	of the control horizon used to compute the control variables.

10., 11., 12.  InitialControlPenaltyFunction, FinalControlPenaltyFunction, ControlPenaltyFunctionIntervalLength

	The control penalty function is applied with a transient staring when the control is 
	turned on the first time in order to avoid a too aggressive action at the beginning.
	A linear variation between "InitialControlPenatyFunction" and "FinalControlPenaltyFunction"
	during a transient of "ControlPenaltyFunctionIntervalLength" time steps is used. After the
	transient the "FinalControlPenaltyFunction" is kept constant.
	The "InitialControlPenaltyFunction" and the  "FinalControlPenaltyFunction" must be grater than zero,
	and the "ControlPenaltyFunctionIntervalLength" must be an integer grater than zero.

13., 14. IdentificationON, IdentificationOFF

	The identifier and the identification input are active between "IdentificationON"  and
	"IdentificationOFF". Outside they are turned off. The "IdentificationON" and "IdentificationOFF"
	are defined in seconds (the control frequency is used to convert the value from second to
	time steps);
	
15., 16., 17., 18., 19., 20., 21., 22. ControlONX, ControlOFFX

	The controller is active in the intervals:
		from "ControlON1" to "ControlOFF1"
		from "ControlON2" to "ControlOFF2"
		from "ControlON3" to "ControlOFF3"
		from "ControlON4" to "ControlOFF4"
	Outside the controller is turned-off. The "ControlONX" and "ControlOFFX" are defined in seconds
	(the control frequency is used to convert the value from second to time steps);

23., 24., 25. IdentificationInputFile, IdentificationInputLength. IdentificationInputScaleFactor

	The "IdentificationInputFile" contains m columns and "IdentificationInputLength" rows. 
	The signals are multiplied by "IdentificationInputScaleFactor" before to be used in
	GPC regulator. "IdentificationInputFile" contains the file name and "IdentificationInputLength"
	must be an integer grater than zero.

26., 27., 28. MeasurementNoiseFile, MeasurementNoiseLength. MeasurementNoiseScaleFactor

	The "MeasurementNoiseFile" contains p columns and "MeasuerementNoiseLength" rows. 
	The signals are multiplied by "MeasurementNoiseScaleFactor" before to be added to the
	measured signals. "MeasurementNoiseFile" contains the file name and "MeasurementNoiseLength"
	must be an integer grater than zero.

29. MeasuresSocketPath

	The "MeasuresSocketPath" is the name of the socket where MBDyn writes the system outputs.
	The same socket path defined in the "file stream" of the MBDyn model must be used.

30. ControlsSocketPath

	The "ControlsSocketPath" is the name of the socket where MBDyn reads the system inputs (
	that is the sum of the identification inputs and the control inputs). The same socket path
	defined in the "stream output" of the MBDyn model must be used.

31. SaveOutputsFlag
	
	The "SaveOutputsFlag" must be equal to 1 or 0. With the value 1 some control outputs
	are saved in the files described below, with the value 0 no outputs are saved, the output
	files names must be always provided.
	
32. ComputedControlInputsFile

	The "ComputedControlInputsFile" is the name of the file where the computed control variables
	are saved.

33. IdentifiedOutputsFile
	
	The "IdentifiedOutputsFile" is the name of the file where the identified system outputs are
	saved.

34. MeasuredOutputsFile
	
	The "MeasureedOutputsFile" is the name of the file where the measured system outputs are
	saved. The comparison with the "IdentifiedOutputsFile" is useful to analyze the quality
	of the identification.


35. ARXparamentersFile
	
	The "ARXparamentersFile" is the name where the parameters of the ARX model are saved for
	each time step.

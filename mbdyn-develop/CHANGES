		  relative rotations)
	Bug fixes:
		- fix unsteady Cm sign bug in unsteady c81 aerodynamics
		- fix input file command line arg delete[] failure 
		- fix linear and parabolic shapes input
		- add consistency check to c81 data header (ITS#4)
		- fix bug in scalar template array drives
	Known bugs:
		- there's a library cross-dependency that's not handled
		  correctly by recent versions of libtool (e.g. 1.4.1).
		- the modal element is skrewed when the modal node 
		  is not clamped (under revision)


MBDyn 1.1.1
	Enhancements:
		- unsteady aerodynamics from Bielawa 31th A.H.S. Forum 1975
		  for C81 aerodynamics
		- unsteady aerodynamic model selection by keywords
		- added renice command-line switch
		- improved approximate friction model of shock absorber
		- penalty also on strain rate in shock absorber (WARNING:
		  changes input syntax)
		- facility for partial force and moment output from rotor
		  elements (set).
		- added threshold switch to axle velocity for tire slip 
		  ratio computation
		- configurable extra output for the iteration engine
		- configurable local and interface solver for parallel build
		- configurable output precision
		- cleanup of the building environment (developers only)
		- useless stuff is not installed on make install
	Bug fixes:
		- fixed bug in tire friction force in module-wheel2
		- fixed bug in tire reference volume computation
		- cleanup of ANSI-fication also in debug build
		- fix bug in calculator (cross type +)
                - fixed parallel build
	Known bugs:
		- parallel build does not work with y12 on both solvers 
		- Built-in naca0012/RAE* unsteady aero still broken


MBDyn 1.1.0
	Enhancements:
		- optimal storage detection for y12m
		- optimization of sparsity handling
		- explicitly referenced std namespace symbols (complying
		  with ANSI C++)
		- Beam slider now works with multiple beams; the classic
		  constraint (no transverse rotations) also works;
		  added a "smearing" parameter that smooths the transition
		  between portions of beam
		- (For developers) Vec3 and Mat3x3 now have () operator;
		  Vec3 also has [] operator
		- "abort after: input;" causes the output as from 
		  initialization after input
		- improved optional parameter input for struct nodes
		- added helper for BDF integration scheme also in dummy steps
		- added support for Umfpack3
		- better header handling/system properties detection
	Bug fixes:
		- Hydraulic nodes did not honor the output flag (always on)
		- minor fixes in documentation
	Known bugs:
		- parallel build still requires HSL library


MBDyn 1.0.1
	Enhancements:
		- better detection of security stuff for socket drive auth
		- detect availability of Pseudo-Inverse to build GPC
		- use strtod/strtol in math parser
		- test for EOF in parsers
		- added keywords in sine/cosine drives for special wave 
		  numbers
		- added helper for BDF integration scheme
		- transition Reynolds numbers moved to fluid properties
		  (still incomplete)
		- reviewed parallel stuff
		- selected documentation updates
	Bug fixes:
		- fixed multiple . in floats in math parser
		- fixed collisions in pam_* names
		- minor fixes


MBDyn 1.0.0
	First release

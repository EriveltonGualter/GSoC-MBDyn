3.1     User supplied subroutines
The user has to supply three problem dependent routines: one for the mul-
tiplication of a vector with the operator A, one for multiplication with B,
and one for performing the preconditioning operation. The subroutine to
multiply with A must be called AMUL and must have the following header:

      subroutine AMUL( n, q, r )
c...............................................
c...     Subroutine to compute r = Aq
c...............................................
      integer        n
      double complex q(n), r(n)

q is the input vector, r the output vector. n is the dimension of the problem.
The subroutine to multiply with B must be called BMUL and must have the
following header:

        subroutine BMUL( n, q, r )
c...............................................
c...        Subroutine to compute r = Bq
c...............................................
        integer            n
        double complex q(n), r(n)

Finally, the routine to perform the preconditioning operation must be called
PRECON and must have the header

        subroutine PRECON( n, q )
c...............................................
c...        Subroutine to compute q = K^-1 q
c...............................................
        integer            n
        double complex q(n)

The preconditioning matrix should be an approximation of the matrix A -
 B, with  the prechosen target value. Preconditioning within the JDQZ
algorithm is described in section 3.4 of [1]. Preconditioning is not essential
for the correct behavior of the algorithm. It should improve the rate of
convergence, but leaving the vector q untouched should have no influence on
the correctness of the results.

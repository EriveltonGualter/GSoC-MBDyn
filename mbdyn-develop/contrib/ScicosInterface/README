=======================================================================
                     Scicos Interface for MBDyn
=======================================================================


Scilab procedure:
- to build blocks (one-time):
  >> exec buildblocks.sci
  (files sockread_comp.c and sockwrite_comp.c expect Scicos headers to be
  in scilab/scicos_blocks/ in the include search tree of the compiler)
- to load blocks (all times before the interface can be executed):
  >> exec loadblocks.sci
- start scicos
- create the Scicos model and connect it to the MBDyn input and 
  output blocks
- Start MBDyn process
- hit "Simulate -> Run";

MBDyn READ block:
- Edit->Add_New_Block and type "READ"
- set the "Hostname" entry to "127.0.0.1"
- set the "Port" entry to the desired port (see services(5) for details
  on usable ports; for details, http://www.mbdyn.org/).
- set the "Number of channels" entry to the desired number of channels
  that will be written by MBDyn to Scicos via the "Stream Output" 
  element (see subsection "Stream output" of section "Output Elements" 
  in "MBDyn Input File Format" for details, http://www.mbdyn.org/).

MBDyn WRITE block:
- Edit->Add_New_Block and type "WRITE"
- set the "Hostname" entry to "127.0.0.1"
- set the "Port" entry to the desired port
- set the "Number of channels" entry to the desired number of channels
  that will be written by Scicos to MBDyn via the "Stream" drive
  (see subsection "Stream" of section "File Drivers" 
  in "MBDyn Input File Format" for details, http://www.mbdyn.org/).

Notes:
- Scicos currently connects to existing sockets created by MBDyn,
  so always set "create, yes" in MBDyn models.
- manually start the MBDyn process; it will wait until Scicos connects
  on both read and write connections.

Examples:
example models are located in the "examples" subdirectory
- pendulum: a simple, inverted pendulum controlled by Scicos using 
  a PD controller

This folder contains a set of octave/matlab scripts that are used
to create the mapping between a set of MBDyn nodes/points.

The mapping is created using create_mls_interface(), implemented
by Giuseppe Quaranta <quaranta@aero.polimi.it>.

It uses a set of functions f_* implemented by Giuseppe Quaranta from
"A Conservative Mesh-Free Approach for Fluid-Structure Interface Problems",
Coupled Problems 2005, Santorini, Greece, May 24-27 2005,
by G. Quaranta, P. Masarati and P. Mantegazza.

These, in turn, make use of a set of functions kd_* by Pramod Vemulapalli,
2010, inspired by the work done by Jan Nunnink, 2003.  They are distributed
under the BSD license, a copy of which is in COPYING.kd.

With the exception of the kd_* functions, the rest of the package
is distributed under the GNU Public License GPL 2.1.

These Blender Python scripts were developed on a Linux  
workstation, and with the exception of the GameBlender 
functionality they have occasionally been shown to work
on a Microsoft Windows operating system.

First, install Blender 2.46+ from http://www.blender.org 
and mbdyn-1.3.6+ from http://www.aero.polimi.it/~mbdyn/

Note for Windows users:
MBDyn binary executables are available at 
http://www.aero.polimi.it/~masarati/Download/mbdyn ,

The following executable was shown to work with v0.1.2 of this script
http://www.aero.polimi.it/~masarati/Download/mbdyn/mbdyn-msys-1.3.4-Beta.exe.
Copy and rename the executable as C:\Program Files\MBDyn\mbdyn.exe, then
look in the mbdyn_gui.py if you encounter errors

Both Blender and MBDyn have websites providing extensive 
installation and usage instructions.

After you have both of these programs working, the two 
Python scripts of this package into a Blender accessible folder,
for instance: 
~/.blender/scripts in Debian Linux, or
C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
   for Windows.

Then start Blender, and in your Python Window click Scripts -> Update Menus.
You will then find that the MBDyn script can be run from your Python Window 
by clicking Scripts -> Animation -> MBDyn

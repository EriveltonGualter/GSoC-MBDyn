=======================================================================
                     Simulink Interface for MBDyn
=======================================================================

You need:
- a working Matlab/Simulink installation; see http://www.mathworks.com
- the "mex" compiler in your PATH; on my system it's in /opt/matlab/bin
- MBDyn 1.2.0 or later
- as Matlab occasionally provides its own version of libraries, like
  libstdc++.so, and populates the environment with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  pointing to its own libraries, you may want to use the mbdyn.sh
  script instead of mbdyn binary, to restore a sane environment before
  running the binary; hack that script to fit your installation
- once for all, you can set MBDyn's install path in Matlab's global path
  (see setup.m; may change in the future)

Simulink procedure:
- File->New->Model
- File->Open->MBDynCom.mdl
- create the simulink model and connect it to the MBDyn input and 
  output blocks
- leave the MBDyn start block alone
- in "Simulation->Simulation Parameters set "Type" to "Fixed Step"
  and set "Fixed Step Size" to the value of the (fixed) time step
- hit "Simulation->Start"; some times, the first run fails; we're
  still trying to track that down.  In case, just try again...

Start MBDyn block:
- set the "MBDyn path" entry to the custom executable path if required;
  better use the mbdyn.sh script, and hack it as appropriate
- set the "Input file" entry to the name of the model file
- set the "Output file" entry to the name of the output file
  if different from that of the model; the path is relative to that
  of the SimulinkInterface directory
- select verbose and pedantic radio buttons as desired

Read MBDyn block:
- unckeck the "RTAI" radio button
- check the "Socket" radio button
- check the "Net/Local" button (means "Net"), because "Local" sockets
  are currently broken
- set the "Node" entry to "127.0.0.1"
- set the "Port" entry to the desired port (see services(5) for details
  on usable ports)
  http://mbdyn.aero.polimi.it/~masarati/MBDyn-input/manual/).
- set the "Number of channels" entry to the desired number of channels
  that will be written by MBDyn to Simulink via the "Stream Output" 
  element (see subsection "Stream output" of section "Output Elements" 
  in "MBDyn Input File Format" for details,
  http://www.aero.polimi.it/~masarati/MBDyn-input/manual/).
- set the "Sample time" entry to the value of the (fixed) time step

Write MBDyn block:
- unckeck the "RTAI" radio button
- check the "Socket" radio button
- check the "Net/Local" button (means "Net"), because "Local" sockets
  are currently broken
- set the "Node" entry to "127.0.0.1"
- set the "Port" entry to the desired port (see services(5) for details
  on usable ports)
- set the "Number of channels" entry to the desired number of channels
  that will be written by Simulink to MBDyn via the "Stream" drive
  (see subsection "Stream" of section "File Drivers" 
  in "MBDyn Input File Format" for details,
  http://mbdyn.aero.polimi.it/~masarati/MBDyn-input/manual/).
- set the "Sample time" entry to the value of the (fixed) time step

Notes:
- simulink currently connects to existing sockets created by MBDyn,
  so always set "create, yes" in MBDyn models.
- local socket seems to be broken at the moment; use inet
  on loopback device.
- in case you can't make the "Start" block work, or if for any reason
  you need a tighter control on MBDyn execution, you can manually start
  the process; it will wait until Simulink connects on both read and write
  connections.

Examples:
example models are located in the "examples" subdirectory
- pendulum: a simple, inverted pendulum controlled by Simulink using 
  a PD controller

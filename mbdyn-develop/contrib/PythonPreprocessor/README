This directory contains a simple preprocessor for MBDyn.

The preprocessor allows to mix standard MBDyn input files 
directives with python code. 
The python code must be enclosed between
the preprocessing directives 

#beginpreprocess

and

#endpreprocess

This allows to easily build any repetitive MBDyn model by
performing loops in python.

MBDyn variables can be declared in python
with the command 

MBVar(name, type, value)

or 

ConstMBVar(name, type, value)

Both commands will create a corresponding python variable that 
you can use in loops _and_ in the declaration of MBDyn nodes and elements.

Instead of writing the result of the arithmetic expression defined with 
these variables, the arithmetic expression themselves will be
written in the input file, to ease its readability.

The preprocessed input file will be written to standard output.
Just pipe it to mbdyn, or redirect it to a different file.

You should study the examples to have a better idea of how to use this tool.

Usage:

python MBDynPreprocess.py input_fine_name

(i.e. python MBDynPreprocess.py CrankPanel_v2.mbd )

The preprocessor should work both with python2 and python3. Feel free
to suggest improvements, corrections and bug fixes.

By default, the preprocessor echoes the python directives in the input file it
produces. This behavior can be disabled with

python MBDynPreprocess.py input_file_name off

valid disabling parameters are 'false', 'no', 'off' and 0. All strings can be
input in uppercase or lowercase, or with just the first letter uppercase.

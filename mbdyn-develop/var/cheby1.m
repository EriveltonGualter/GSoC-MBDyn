## Generate an Chebyshev type I filter with Rp dB of pass band ripple.
## 
## [b, a] = cheby1(n, Rp, Wc)
##    low pass filter with cutoff pi*Wc radians
##
## [b, a] = cheby1(n, Rp, Wc, 'high')
##    high pass filter with cutoff pi*Wc radians
##
## [b, a] = cheby1(n, Rp, [Wl, Wh])
##    band pass filter with edges pi*Wl and pi*Wh radians

##
## [z, p, g] = cheby1(...)
##    return filter as zero-pole-gain rather than coefficients of the
